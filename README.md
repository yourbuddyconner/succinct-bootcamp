# Succinct Bootcamp Notes

Welcome to my notes repository from Succinct's in-house "bootcamp" lecture series. I'm Conner Swann ([@yourbuddyconner](https://twitter.com/yourbuddyconner)), and I'm sharing these notes as a public resource for anyone interested in zero-knowledge proofs and Succinct's technology.

## About These Notes

This repository contains PDF lecture notes from Succinct's internal training program, covering various aspects of zero-knowledge proof technology with a focus on our ZKVM, 0-SP1. These notes are my personal take on the material presented and are shared to help others learn about this exciting field.

## Repository Contents

The `notes/` folder contains PDF documents covering topics such as:

- Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Arithmetization and Proof Systems
- SP1 Core Architecture
- RISC-V Compilation and Execution in SP1
- Multi-table STARK Architecture
- Lookup Arguments and Memory Management
- Precompiles in SP1
- Recursive Proofs and Compression
- SP1 Prover Service Architecture

Please note that these are living documents and may be updated or expanded over time.

## Why This Matters

Zero-knowledge proofs are at the cutting edge of cryptography and blockchain technology. By sharing these notes, I hope to:

1. Contribute to the broader ZKP community's knowledge base
2. Showcase the depth and complexity of work in the ZKP space
3. Provide a learning resource for those interested in this technology

## About Succinct

[Succinct](https://succinct.xyz/) is at the forefront of making zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) accessible to developers. Their flagship product, 0-SP1, is an open-source zkVM (zero-knowledge Virtual Machine) that allows developers to write ZKPs using Rust.

Key features of SP1 include:
- Write ZKPs in Rust, leveraging existing crates and libraries
- Generate proofs rapidly, making ZKPs practical for various applications
- 100x developer productivity compared to traditional ZKP development
- State-of-the-art performance through a "precompile-centric" architecture

SP1 is designed for applications such as rollups, bridges, privacy-preserving systems, on-chain machine learning, and advanced cryptography. Succinct also offers a decentralized prover network for easy proof generation.

Recently, Succinct raised $55M in a funding round led by Paradigm to further their mission of making ZKPs accessible to any developer.
